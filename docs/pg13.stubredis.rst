pg13.stubredis module
=====================

Don't worry about this if you're on unix or osx.

For windows users, this provides something kind of like a redis server.

To use this, install these packages that aren't referenced by the pg13 installer:

* `hiredis` (optional, for performance)
* `redis` (mandatory)

.. automodule:: pg13.stubredis
